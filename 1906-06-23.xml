                            station at Chstby. It is true that the batbs at San Stefano and Mex are
                            all that could be desired, but distance and the time necessary to go to
                            these baths undoubtedly preolude a large number of bathers from
                            indulging in their favourite pastime as often as they otherwise would.
                            The Chstby baths have therefore come to fill a decided want- resort
                            within easy reach of the city, but which at the same time supplies all
                            the desiderata of bathers. Taking a car at the city terminus, you are
                            transported in the space of five mioutes to this newly-erected casino,
                            where the bracing sea a breeze is to be had in all its freshness. A E
                            tramway station has been made almost opposite i the baths, which provide
                            accommodation for d 150 bathers, there being 70 gentlemen's and 80 |
                            ladies' cabins, all airy and open to the sea, The beach is sandy and the
                            depth of water varies from zero to 2 metres on the men's side and to 1)
                            metres on the ladies' side. Between the two sides a large terrape bas
                            been erected where on a buffet bas been installed. For those who wish
                            for nothing more than a "blow" in these warm months, the baths will be
                            deoided boon,</p>

                        <p>PETITION TO THE PREMIER</p>
                        <p>Nagaib Bey Sbakrs, advocate and proprietor of the 'Istiklal" magazine,
                            Cairo, sends as copy of a petition which he sabmitted yester day to the
                            President of the Council of Ministera, on behalf of the inhabitants of
                            Helouan.</p>
                        <p>The petition se's forth that whilomanyimprovements have teen made during
                            the last five years in Cairo and the neighbouring distriots, even in the
                            desert, Helogan, which is one of the most beautiful towns of Egypt, is
                            still greatly in need of improvement.</p>
                        <p>The petitioner asserts that the Helosan branch of the Delta Light Railway
                            is still in a very defective condition. There is a great difference, he
                            says, in every respe st, between this line and the Matarieh railway. It
                            is true that the latter belongs to the State Railway Administration,
                            which spares no effort to keep its trains and stations in good order,
                            but the Government can compel the Delta Light Railway Company to either
                            improve its Helouan line or give up its concession.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="item">
                        <p>After pointing out that people find great diffioulties in travelling from
                            Cairo to Helonan and vioe-versa, Sbakra Bey, on bebalf of the people of
                            Helouan, makes the following requests :</p>
                        <p>1. That the railway line between Bab elLook, Cairo, and Helouan should be
                            doubled and arrangements made for one train to leave every 30 minutes;
                            or that trams should replace trains.</p>
                        <p>2. To bring the Heloaan line ap to the | standard of tha Matarieb railway
                            in material, rolling-stook and personnel.</p>
                        <p>3. To construot two roads for motor cars at Helouan, one to the Nile and
                            the other to the foot of the mountain ; which scheme might be undertaken
                            by a company composed of some of the chief land-owners of Helouan, if
                            the Government would not enter apon it.</p>
                        <p>4. If the Delta Light Railway Company refuses to carry out the required
                            improvements the Government will have to purchase its Helouan line and
                            place it under the State Railway Administration.</p>
                        <p>We should like to poʻnt out that the Helonan line, while still in need of
                            improvement, is in al far better condition than two years ago. As for
                            Shakra Bay's suggestion that a train should leave for Helouan overy
                            half-hour, we have little doubt that the financial result of such an
                            alteration of the time-table would be decidedly | unplexadt. Halosan is,
                            after all, not large town, the passenger traffi) falls off in sommer,
                            and the goods traffic is not very important. As for the "motor-roads,"
                            how are they to pay ! Will the bypothetioal company levy tolls on
                            motors, or how will it reimburse itself for the expenses of construction
                            ? The petitioner does not seem to as to have weighed the financial
                            consequences of his proposals.</p>

                    <p>NOCTURNAL ARREST.</p>
                    <p>* EXCITING CHASE IN CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>We bave received the following communication from a correspondent in Cairo
                        :</p>
                    <p>Yesterday morning, at about 3 o'clock, an | Englishman was returbing from a
                        bachelor's dinner and bridge party, and on passing the Sharia Madabogh,
                        close to the now premises of Messrs. Walker and Meimarachi, be noticed a
                        number of suspicious characters loitering round.</p>
                    <p>Anticipating some fun, our informant waited in a dark cort er for
                        developments in the hope of perhaps assisting in the capture of some noted
                        Anarchist or more probably a raid on a gambling hell.</p>
                    <p>His patience was rewarded eventually: the too conspicuous detectives (sic)
                        almost imme diately stopped a native lady who resembled the foolish virgins
                        in not having her lamp barning, and after submitting ber to a close
                        examination, possibly to see it she possessed any bombs, she was allowed to
                        proceed. Scarcely bad she proceeded 50 yards, however, befora there was a
                        cry of "imaikoa" |(equivalent to "Stop thief") and the whole posse of
                        detectives started rapning down the street towards Sharia Boulac with,
                        naturally, the Englishman in hot pursuit.</p>
                    <p>The chase, however, was not organised for the benefit of the lady, as might
                        be presamed by our foregoing remarks. The "eagle eye" | of the secret
                        service had unearthed a suspected criminal, or Anarchist, heaven knows from
                        where, and as the quarry had 'gone away" as smartly as any Reynard from
                        cover, the posse went off like hounds on a hot scent.</p>
                    <p>Our friend the Englishman dropped out at the first lap and finding a carriage
                        immediate ly opposite the English Church followed up the chase to the
                        building in course of constraction behind the Egyptian telegraph offices in
                        the Sharia Boolse: the name of the driver of the carriage was Said Ahmed
                        Ali, bis number 3892, ant the number of his cab 1077. The pursued was run to
                        earth in the chantiers" | already mentioned and our informant arrived in
                        time to see him bandled into a cab with three lasty guardians who showed
                        scant courtesy; as a matter of fact one was dietinctly heard to ask for a
                        rope !</p>
                    <p>No sooner had our Englishman arrived on the scene than he way surrounded by
                        that part of the posse who ware not occupied with the supposed oriminal and
                        promptly arrested with out any enquiry, - a respectably dressed Bng.
                        Jishman, who spoke Italian and Arabic too well to allow for the momeat the
                        idea of any misunderstanding, was arrested by a crowd of | ignorant secret
                        service agents. He was bundled into his own c.b again with ghuffi No. 10 of
                        ba Ismailia quarter gripping his right wrist in a totally uncalled-for
                        manner and a police spy named Mohamed Sadik on the left. Towering over him
                        was a Baropean, seemingly Maltese, whose name was unobtainable. The manner
                        in which our inform unt was handled was too rough for words: he says his
                        fighting weight is 9 stone 6, so it is difficult to imagine wby three strong
                        men should be required to hold him, more particularly as he did not resist
                        in the slightest, well knowing that he could easily clear himself of any
                        complicity with the fagitive. As a matter of fact the victim is still
                        feeling the results of his rough bandling, although it is jast to say he was
                        not truck. "</p>
                    <p>On arriving at the Abdəea caracol our informant presented his card to the
                        officer on duty and immediately received from that gentleman the greatest
                        courtesy : the supposed criminal was asked if he knew the Englishman and
                        promptly disclaimed any knowledge of having seen him before. Our friend the
                        Britisher, who is a very peppery individual, then started roundly rating the
                        whole assembly and insisted on immediate release, which was strongly opposed
                        by the Maltese gentleman, but thanks to the courtesy of the officer in

                        pay himself for the carriage in which he had been so roughly bundled.</p>
                    <p>A fall explanation and complete satistaetion for this outrage would feem to
                        be necessary : that a law abiding person, only too anxious to be of
                        assistance to the polioe, and manifesting a perfectly legitimate curiosity
                        during an excit|ing occurence, should be arrested without the | slightest
                        chance of justification and handled</p>
                    <p>like a felon by an ill-conditioned band of so-called secret police is
                        intolerable, and despite our duty to assist in opholding a public body we
                        are compelled to criticise the action of the police in this matter. The
                        gentleman from whom we have this complaint | is a member of the Press and
                        desires a fall enquiry into the matter. One thing is pretty certain, that
                        had be not defended himself very vigorously (with his tongue), he would be
                        at the present moment in "durance</p>
                    <p>We should like to point out that while the agents of the secret police appear
                        to have grossly expeeded their powers, &amp; gentleman who indulged in games
                        of hide and seek round dark corners at 2 a.m. in London or Paris, and joined
                        anasked in the pursuit of a fogi. tive, would ran considerable risk of
                        passing the night in the "lock-up," and the moral in our opinion is, when
                        returning from a bachelor's party at 2 a.m.: GO STRAIGHT HOME, and remember
                        the ancient proverb 'Curiosity killed the cat.'"</p>

                <p>The 1st Battalion Royal Ioniskilling Fasiliers, Belfast, will troop the colours
                    on Monday next in commemoration of the glorious part the old 27th Inniskillings
                    played in the ever-memorable battle of Waterloo. The officers will give a dance
                    the following evening. The 27th was distingaished at Waterloo by its heroio
                    endurance in a hell of fire," and its terrible losses in killed and woanded.</p>
                <p>The 2nd Battalion Leicestershire Regiment, Brevet Colonel E.R. Scott commanding,
                    which go3g from Colchester to India next trooping Season, was last in "The
                    Shiny" from 1876 to 1898, the two sacoeeding years being spont in Barmsh and
                    Aden. It went from Ireland to Bgypt in 1900, and came home in the latter end of
                    1992. Its 1st Battalion, now at Belgaum, will return home in turn this coming
                    relief 8888on. It was in South Africa when the Boer War broke out, and shared a
                    gallant part in | the defence of Ladysmith and the actions of</p>
                <p>Tulana Hill and Lombard's Kop, which preceded the investment of that place.</p>
                <p>It is authoritatively stated that the new army scheme, the full details of which
                    will be given by Mr. Haldane next month, will include provision for the
                    long-talked-of territorial army for home defence, and a foreign service army for
                    duty in India, Egypt and the Colonies. The army as it stands will be redece by
                    43 rogalar batteries of horse and field artillery, and these will be replaced by
                    militia batteries, which necessarily must be able to go on foreiga sørvioe if
                    required to do so; the infantry will be reduced by 10,000 men, and the Army
                    Service Corps by twenty companies. The volunteerr, yeomanry, and militia will be
                    consolidatedan utter impossibility to anyone who understands anything about the
                    personnel of those bodies—and a reduction will be made in the strength of the
                    yeomanry. In short, the scheme, so far as is known about it, is a re-bash of
                    some of Mr. Arnold Forster's fads, with nothing to recommend it, save a false
                    sconomy. The outlook of those who will suffer in pay and promotion is by no
                    means reassaring.</p>
                <p>It appears that the now 18-pounder field gan has a tendency to turc tartle" under
                    certain conditions owing to the centre of gravity being considerably above the
                    axle. This in turn is due to the peouliar construction of the gun and the recoil
                    apparatus. On broken ground, when palled round suddenly, the gun inolines to
                    topple over, and several nasty spills hsve resalted at Tidworth and elsewhere
                    one case being very unfortanately attended by fatal resulta. Oa active service
                    this woald be a very serious matter. Experts of the Ordnance Dapartment are
                    inquiring into the defect. It is officially stated thist out of the 150 field
                    batteries now on the establishment only 109 will be equipped with the new field
                    gon, whilst 21 of the existing 38 batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery will
                    receive the new 13-pounder. la artillery circle, the threatened reduction of the
                    Royal Regiment is bitterly resented, and condemned.</p>
                <p>The programme for the building of several battleships of the Dreadnought type is
                    to be oat dowo, for the sake of economy.</p>
